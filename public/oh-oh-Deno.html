            I got sick and tired of stupid <code>node_modules</code> folders in
            my repo. I also hate having virtualenvs in there, but I can put
            those wherever I want. But <code>node_modules</code> are apparently
            unmovable.

            I don't use JavaScript huge amounts but I got annoyed enough that I
            decided to ask Claude if there was any way round it, and after a bit
            of prodding it admitted that I could switch to Deno. Given that I
            only use it as a glorified script runner, it's working pretty well
            so far.
