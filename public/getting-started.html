          <h1>Getting Started with Static Site Generators</h1>
          <p>
            Static site generators have become incredibly popular for tech
            blogs, and for good reason. They offer the perfect balance of
            simplicity, performance, and developer experience.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Choose a Static Site Generator?</h2>
          <p>
            There are several compelling reasons to use a static site generator
            for your tech blog:
          </p>
          <h3>Performance</h3>
          <p>
            Static sites load incredibly fast since they're just HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript files served from a CDN. No database queries or
            server-side processing needed.
          </p>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            With no server-side code or database, there's very little attack
            surface. Your site is essentially unhackable.
          </p>
          <h3>Version Control</h3>
          <p>
            Your entire site, including content, lives in version control. You
            can track changes, collaborate, and deploy with git.
          </p>
          <h3>Markdown Support</h3>
          <p>
            Write your posts in Markdown, which is perfect for technical content
            with code snippets and formatting.
          </p>
          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>The basic workflow is simple:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Write your posts in Markdown</li>
            <li>Run a build command to generate static HTML</li>
            <li>Deploy the generated files to any web server</li>
          </ol>
          <pre><code class="language-bash"># Create a new draft
npm run new &quot;My Amazing Post&quot;

# Edit the draft in drafts/my-amazing-post.md

# When ready, publish it
npm run publish my-amazing-post

# Build the site
npm run build
</code></pre>
          <p>That's it! Your new post is live.</p>
          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>In future posts, I'll dive deeper into advanced topics like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Custom templates and styling</li>
            <li>SEO optimization</li>
