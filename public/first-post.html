I knew it was something from the past, but couldn't remember what.</p>
<p>A way in which AI is already changing my life, is that I just asked ChatGPT and it pointed out that it was likely due to old message boards like Slashdot. And it was exactly right. I haven't even thought of Slashdot in over a decade, but I used to be an avid user, and even had a lowish user ID number on it (which used to be a matter of pride there).</p>
<p>I had given up on Google quite a while ago, but recently I've found myself much more likely to do &quot;Hmm what about ü§î&quot; type queries in ChatGPT and Claude, and as I result I'm learning lots. Some of it true.</p>
