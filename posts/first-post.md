When I decided to create a website (mainly to show off what I've been building with AI), I had the irresistible desire to go "First Post", but I couldn't workout why.  I knew it was something from the past, but couldn't remember what.

A way in which AI is already changing my life, is that I just asked ChatGPT and it pointed out that it was likely due to old message boards like Slashdot.  And it was exactly right. I haven't even thought of Slashdot in over a decade, but I used to be an avid user, and even had a lowish user ID number on it (which used to be a matter of pride there).

I had given up on Google quite a while ago, but recently I've found myself much more likely to do "Hmm what about ðŸ¤”" type queries in ChatGPT and Claude, and as I result I'm learning lots.  Some of it true.
