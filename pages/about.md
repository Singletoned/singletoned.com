# About This Blog

Welcome to my tech blog! This is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings about technology, programming, and software development.

## About the Site

This blog is built with a custom static site generator using:

- **Markdown** for writing articles
- **Pug.js** for templating
- **Node.js** for the build system
- Minimal, semantic CSS for styling

The source code is simple and lightweight, focusing on content over complexity.
