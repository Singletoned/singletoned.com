# Getting Started with Static Site Generators

Static site generators have become incredibly popular for tech blogs, and for good reason. They offer the perfect balance of simplicity, performance, and developer experience.

## Why Choose a Static Site Generator?

There are several compelling reasons to use a static site generator for your tech blog:

### Performance
Static sites load incredibly fast since they're just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files served from a CDN. No database queries or server-side processing needed.

### Security
With no server-side code or database, there's very little attack surface. Your site is essentially unhackable.

### Version Control
Your entire site, including content, lives in version control. You can track changes, collaborate, and deploy with git.

### Markdown Support
Write your posts in Markdown, which is perfect for technical content with code snippets and formatting.

## Getting Started

The basic workflow is simple:

1. Write your posts in Markdown
2. Run a build command to generate static HTML
3. Deploy the generated files to any web server

```bash
# Create a new draft
npm run new "My Amazing Post"

# Edit the draft in drafts/my-amazing-post.md

# When ready, publish it
npm run publish my-amazing-post

# Build the site
npm run build
```

That's it! Your new post is live.
